# PopStompbox

**Hey ! Welcome to this DIY Stompbox project.**

First of all, what is a stompbox ? According to lexico.com, there are several definitions :
> * A foot-operated device that produces a sound effect on an electric guitar.
> * A wooden box used as a percussion instrument, sounded by being struck with the feet or hands.

Here, I am talking about the second one. Basically, I just want something to hit with the foot producing a "clap! clap!" to give us the rhythm while I play guitar. :-)

If you are in, follow me !
